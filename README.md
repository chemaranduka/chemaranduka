# Che Marandu Aranduka

Fictional company by [Shiru](https://github.com/jeffersonroth).

The fictional company (**Che Marandu Aranduka**) started as bookstore (1992) in Paraguay named **Mombe’upy**.
Later (2012), the company adopted and gained a considerable share of the books e-commerce market in that country (mombeu.py).
Recently, they identified a good growth opportunity, by having a vertical of luxury school and office supplies products, including subscription boxes.

The company decided to create an App to work with the new vertical, the **ArandukApp**, an app that offers planners, journals, notebooks, calendars, and other cool premium school and office supplies. The app also integrates products from the bookstore ecommerce (Mombe’upy).
**ArandukApp** is available in three apps: iOS, Android, Web.

ArandukApp delivers its products using its own delivery service.
The person working to deliver the products (*Pe kuimba’e omoguahẽva*, or the rider), or **Jaguaru** (wolf) for short.

The company's name comes from the Guarani words **Che** (I, my, me, mine), **Marandu** (news, information), and **Aranduka** (book), loosely meaning **My Personal Diary**.
**Mombe'upy** means legends, and **Mombe'u** means stories, to announce, to communicate, or to inform.

## Users & Customers
Mainly two types of users: individual customers (students, professionals), and business (office locations, schools).

## Business Model
### Mombe’upy
Traditional bookstore ecommerce.

### ArandukApp
Immediate or planned delivery (time slots) of ArandukApp luxury products and products from commercial partners, Mombe’upy products, and ecommerce vertical. Some commercial partners may also offer subscription boxes, and custom products the customer may subscribe to.

The ArandukApp luxury products are white-label products from local and international brands.

The ecommerce vertical is an ecommerce inside the app, where commercial partners can offer their products through the app, using ArandukApp delivery services, or their own.

### Business, Advertising and Marketing White-label products
Vertical where other companies can white-label some of the luxury products for business, advertising, and marketing purposes.
For example: office supplies for new hirings, business events, conferences, etc.
This vertical is not available in Mombe’upy ecommerce, nor in the ArandukApp, but only directly with the company.
